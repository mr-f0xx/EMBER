## Features

- **Folder browsing** straight off the SD card (Artist → Album → Track), natural-sorted, no library scan/database step.
- **MP3, FLAC, WAV, and AAC** playback.
- **Themeable UI** — 10 built-in themes (Ember, 90's Sweater, Aqua, Honey, Moody, Terminal Green, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Gruvbox, Catppuccin), plus a [browser-based theme editor](#custom-themes) for making your own and loading them from the SD card, no recompiling required.
- **Two full-screen visualizers**: a real FFT spectrum analyzer (bars + peak-hold + waveform overlay + stereo level meter), and a full-screen silhouette dance visualizer that reacts to bass hits in the music.
- **Now Playing extras**: embedded album art (JPEG/PNG/BMP/QOI), an animated turntable placeholder for tracks with no art, a small amplitude visualizer, seek with double-tap-to-restart/skip, and battery/volume meters.
- **Settings**: backlight level, screen-off timeout, end-of-album behavior, and theme — all persisted across reboots.
- **On-device screenshot capture** (see [Screenshots](#taking-your-own-screenshots) below) for pulling real UI captures without photographing the screen.
- **Multi-language support** displays Japanese, Chinese, Cyrillic (Russian, etc.), Greek, and accented Latin (French, German, Spanish, etc). 

## Hardware

- M5Stack Cardputer ADV (ESP32-S3, no PSRAM).
- A microSD card for your music (and optionally custom themes — see below).

## Controls

The Cardputer has no dedicated arrow keys — the punctuation cluster doubles as one: `;` `.` `,` `/` map to up/down/back/open.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `;` / `.` | Move selection up/down in the file browser |
| `,` | Back / up a folder (at the root, opens Now Playing instead) |
| `/` | Open selected folder or track |
| `` ` `` | Back, from anywhere |
| Enter | Open / play |
| Space | Play / pause |
| `,` / `/` (Now Playing) | Seek back/forward; double-tap to restart / skip to next track |
| `n` / `b` | Next / previous track |
| `-` / `=` | Volume down / up |
| `m` | Toggle Now Playing screen |
| `v` (Now Playing) | Cycle full-screen visualizer: spectrum → dancers → back |
| `a` (Now Playing) | Toggle turntable placeholder vs. real album art |
| `s` | Settings |
| `c` | Save a screenshot to `/screenshots` on the SD card (hold to burst-capture) |

## Custom themes

Every color in the UI — backgrounds, text, selection highlight, visualizer tiers, all of it — comes from one theme struct, editable without touching any drawing code.

**Make your own:** open the [theme editor](https://horseyofcoursey.github.io/EMBER/tools/theme-editor.html) in a browser. It shows a live, device-accurate preview (colors are quantized to the Cardputer's actual 16-bit display depth, so what you see is what you'll get) of the browser, Now Playing, and visualizer screens as you tweak each color.

**Use it on your device (no recompiling):** on the JSON tab, click **Download**, then copy the file into a `/themes` folder on your SD card. After a reboot, it shows up as an extra option under **Settings → Theme**.

The editor also works completely offline as a local file (`tools/theme-editor.html`) if you'd rather not use the hosted copy.

## Taking your own screenshots

Press `c` on any screen to save a BMP to `/screenshots` on the SD card; hold it to burst-capture a sequence (useful for the animated screens). There's no timestamp metadata (no RTC on this board), so if you need to tell capture sessions apart afterward, diffing consecutive frames for content changes works well.
